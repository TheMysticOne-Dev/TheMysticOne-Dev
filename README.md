<!-- Hello Random User, I'm "TheMysticOne" (@TheMysticOne-Dev) and I'm interested in Software Development in a professional field. I am currently a Game Developer using
game engines/frameworks such as (GameMaker, Clickteam/Multimedia Fusion, Unity) and learning the new boys in town (Godot and Gdevelop). I'm currently learning (besides
the previous said game engines/frameworks) how to create Windows (NT) applications without using GUI based programs like Visual Studio (Windows Form App Editor). I'm
also learning some other programming languages like (Java, HTML/JavaScript/CSS, and Rust). I'm looking forward to collaborating on projects that are "Game Development"
based either as a programmer or artist (Disclaimer: My art skills are not very good*). I don't have any open emails were you can contact me but I do have a Discord,
Twitter, and Reddit account (I don't use Reddit*). --!>

Here is a better format that doesn't look like a high school essay.

- I'm "TheMysticOne" (@TheMysticOne-Dev) with my irl name being Anthony (Please get to know me before calling me that*)

- I'm a Game Developer and a inspiring Software Developer to bring my skill to a professional level.

- I'm currently learning some new game engines/frameworks and programming languages like Godot, Java, WebDEV, and Rust.
(WebDEV == "HTML5/JavaScript/CSS3")

- I mostly leave my socials closed not for any reason but to stop harassment, I'll think about opening them in the future.
